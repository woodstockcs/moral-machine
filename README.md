On edublogs, make a post discussing this:

- Discuss two of the most challenging scenarios you worked on. What kind of preference (bias?) did you need to apply to choose one of these options?
- Do you think that morality of self-driving cars is going to involve certain kinds of social bias?  
- Do you think there is anything we can do about it?
